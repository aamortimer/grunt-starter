Basic Grunt Setup
=================

Starting point for grunt projects

You should work in the app directory, and not the generated public directory. Grunt will generate the public directory with all sass and js files minified and combined.

##Installation

```
cd project
npm install
npm install -g grunt-cli
grunt
```
